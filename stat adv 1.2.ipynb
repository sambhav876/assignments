    "#he normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution or bell curve, is widely used in various fields to model the distribution of random variables. Here are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model:\n",

    "Biological Measurements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Heights or weights of a population.\n",
    "Explanation: Human height and weight often follow a normal distribution, making it a suitable model for these biological measurements.\n",
    "Educational Testing:\n",
